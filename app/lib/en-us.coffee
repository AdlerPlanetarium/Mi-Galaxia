        Born and raised in Chile, Julieta has been thinking about space ever since she started reading science fiction books and "El Tesoro de la Juventud" (Youth’s Treasure), a 20-book encyclopedia in all subjects, from science to literature and art, edited and printed in Mexico. Today, she wants to have the best understanding of all the various media she can use in collaboration with other professionals to find new knowledge. Her curiosity has led her to graphic design and electronic visualization, but also art history, film, philosophy, programming, gaming, and mathematics, all in their relation to space. She blames her eagerness to study human behavior on the influence of her parents conversations. At the Adler Julieta designs around the space of the human mind, channelled by the body we use to navigate and interact with physical space, as well as the spaces we create to experience the vast Universe. Besides her work at Adler, where she is the Associate Director of the Space Visualization Laboratory (SVL), she is a PhD candidate in interactive arts at the University of Plymouth, UK.

She began working with Latino migrant communities through an outreach program of science that she created in Evanston called Playing with Science. The objective of the program is to familiarize young people and parents with science. In this program, invited Latino scientists from the Chicago area stop by to share their life stories and organize fun activities that allow families to put some scientific principles into practice. It has been during this period of time that she discovered the importance of creating a space where parents can connect with their children, young people can learn Latin America through the experiences of other young people and the visiting scientists, but especially where science is fun when shown as part of everyday life.

        Laura Trouille grew up in the Chicago area and got her first taste for astronomy through school field trips to the Adler Planetarium. It’s a dream come true for her to now be an astronomer at the Adler and at Northwestern University. Her research is on black holes; understanding how massive black holes affect how their host galaxies evolve over billions of year timescales. She also mentor students in research, teaches astronomy, gives public talks, and works with teachers. She is passionate about helping the next generation of women and minorities access education and careers in math, science, and technology and works with the American Astronomical Society Committee on the Status of Women in Astronomy in these efforts.
