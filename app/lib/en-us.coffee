          Astronomers believe that the Universe we live in originated some 13700 million years ago. The topic of how the standar model of the Big Bang emerged will be addressed through a series of demonstrations. During this presentation some astronomical means of the production of elements will be described, as well as the reasons that have led astronomers to think that this is a valid model. It will be mentioned that the Universe is everything: space, time, matter and energy, and that its evolution continues. The bodies that form the cosmos as well as their spatial distribution will be briefly described. Cosmic expansion, chemical abundance of the elements and problems of night darkenss and dark matter will be addressed. The talk will conclude by mentioning problems related to energy release, chaos and the future of our Universe.

The development of optics has been very important in the development of scientific and technical  knowledge. The presence of the Sun is necessary for our eyes to be able to see. Why do you think that is? Through scientific demonstrations and activities related with optics, families qill be able to understand principles linked tolight and vision, which have served as the basis to the development of observing instruments.

We are taught at school that matter can only be found in trhee states: solid, liquid and gaseous. But, have you ever wondered what stars are made of? In this workshop we will cover topics such as what matter is, and what is its composition. Through interactive experiences, a Latino physicist will explain some physical and chemical phenomena, through which you will be able to discover basic principles that present in objects of nature, and are utilized for the development of materials through history.
