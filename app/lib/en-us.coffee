        Growing up "good at art", Julieta has been thinking about space ever since she started reading science fiction books in the 5th grade near the Andes mountains in Chile, her native country. She wants to have the best understanding of all the various media she can use in collaboration with other professionals to find new knowledge. Her curiosity led her to graphic design and electronic visualization, but also art history, film, philosophy, programming, gaming, and mathematics, all in their relation to space. She blames her eagerness to study human behavior on the influence of her parents' detective-like practice of medicine, reflected in family dinner conversations growing up. At the Adler Julieta explores the space of the human mind, channelled by the body we use to navigate and interact with physical space as well as in the visualizations we create to experience the vast Universe. Besides her work at Adler, where she is the Associate Director of the Space Visualization Laboratory (SVL), she is a PhD candidate in interactive arts at the Universe of Plymouth, UK.

        Zamanillo Isabel Carrera is a Mexican biologist with training in science education. In 2012 he moved to Chicago, looking for new career opportunities. He began working with Latino migrant communities through an outreach program of science that created in Evanston called Playing with Science. The objective of the program is to familiarize young people and parents with science, scientists inviting Latinos in the Chicago area to share their life stories and organizing fun activities that allow families to see some scientific principles into practice. During this period he discovered the importance of creating a space where parents can connect with their children, young people can learn Latin through the experiences of other young people and visiting scientists, but especially where science is fun showing part of everyday life.

        Laura Trouille grew up in the Chicago area and got her first taste for astronomy through school field trips to the Adler Planetarium. It’s a dream come true for her to now be an astronomer at the Adler and at Northwestern University. Her research is on black holes; understanding how massive black holes affect how their host galaxies evolve over billions of year timescales. She also mentor students in research, teaches astronomy, gives public talks, and works with teachers. She is passionate about helping the next generation of women and minorities access education and careers in math, science, and technology and works with the American Astronomical Society Committee on the Status of Women in Astronomy in these efforts. She spent a lot of time as a kid in France on her grandmother’s farm, which is surely part of the reason why she loves to cook. She also has two cats and a wonderful and supportive husband.
